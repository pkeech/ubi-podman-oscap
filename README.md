### Description
This Image is based upon the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) 8 and includes `Podman` and `OpenSCAP`. **Note:** Normally, OpenSCAP is only available in a Red Hat or CentOS repo. In this Image, the `RPM` packages are pulled from an Online repo and installed manually.

### Usage
Use the following steps to build and run this Docker Image. Additionally, this image can be used within a CI/CD Pipeline.

1. Build the Docker image and tag `docker build src -t << IMAGE-NAME >>`
2. Create a Temporary Docker Volume `docker volume create podman-temp`
3. Run the Docker Image `docker run -it --rm --privileged -v podman-temp:/var/lib/containers << IMAGE-NAME >>`

### Notes
Listed below are notes about this image:

* Currently, this image requires the `--privileged` tag. Another image will be created to remove this requirement.
* You will need to include the required benchmarks to perform a scan.
* A volume needs to be mapped to `/var/lib/containers`. This appears to be a requirement for `podman`.
